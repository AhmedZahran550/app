If you are connected to a Wi-Fi network on your laptop and want to retrieve the Wi-Fi password using the command line interface (CLI), you can follow these steps:

Open the Command Prompt or PowerShell on your Windows laptop by pressing the Windows key + R, typing cmd or powershell, and pressing Enter.

Type the following command and press Enter:

sql
Copy code
netsh wlan show profile
This will show a list of all the Wi-Fi networks you've connected to in the past. Note the name of the network whose password you want to retrieve.

Type the following command and press Enter, replacing NETWORK_NAME with the name of the network:

arduino
Copy code
netsh wlan show profile "NETWORK_NAME" key=clear
This will display detailed information about the network, including the network security key, which is the Wi-Fi password. Look for the line that says "Key Content" under the "Security settings" section.

Note that you may need to have administrative privileges on your laptop to retrieve the Wi-Fi password using the CLI.
